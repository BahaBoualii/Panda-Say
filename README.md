# PandaSay

PandaSay is a fun command-line tool, similar to the famous "cowsay" project, written in Go that generates ASCII art of a panda with a speech bubble containing a message provided by the user.

## Usage

After you clone the project to your machine you just start using it as the example below:

```bash
"Hello there" | go run .
 _____________
< Hello there >
